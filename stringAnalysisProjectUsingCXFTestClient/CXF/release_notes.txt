8. Known issues

If you are using AES encryption with GCM for symmetric encryption in
XML/WS-Security, there is a problem if you are using BouncyCastle < 1.49 or
1.50. To circumvent this either of the following steps can be taken:

a) Upgrade to BouncyCastle 1.49 (or 1.51 when it gets released) OR
b) Set the system property "org.apache.xml.security.cipher.gcm.useIvParameterSpec" to "true".
